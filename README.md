# TestBed

TestBed is the codename of a website project created between recent graduate students Jeremy Crooke and Jared Scott. 
This website is intended to supplement aspects of computer science not heavily covered in either graduate's study, 
namely, web development. Here you will find the use of languages and tools such as HTML, CSS, PHP, mySql, JavaScript, 
and so forth. 

It is both developers' desire to not only increase their coding skills, but also gain experience in a team environment 
where new coders can contribute as team members. We warmly welcome any coder, regardless of experience, who would like to
be a part of the team.
